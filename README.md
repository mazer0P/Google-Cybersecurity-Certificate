# Google-Cybersecurity-

This Repository describes about the journey of getting the google cybersecurity professional certificate.

This course contains 8 different courses which combinely makes the certificate.

# First Course :
Foundations of Cybersecurity
 This was the begining where almost the overview of every course was given. Learned about the SIEM Tools, Frameworks , Some popular attacks like the LoveLetter, which shaped the infosec community, NIST frameworks, CIA triad, and other base info sec knowledge.

 # Second Course : 
 Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks
 This course dive deep into Frameworks like NIST and controls , CIA triad, OWASP principles etc.
 
 In first two modules some key learnings were:
- How frameworks helps in lowering the risk in crucial time
- learned how framework provides guidance to act and investigate the issue and prevent the further damage,recover data loss or any harm during the breach or other compromised times.
- CISSP's eight principles which are followed by organisations in order to comply security of domains.
- identify, protect using tools, policies and procedures, detect using improvised techniques, respond using security processes, recover the system.
- Learned about the security audits how these audits helps organizations in keeping up there business needs and goals.
- Performed a security audit for a fictional company Botium Toys, learned about how to review security scope and goals, reviewed and finalize the availability and usage of important security compliances.
- learned why logs and there understanding is important in the InfoSec industry.
- learned about SIEM tools such as Splunk , Google chronicle and how they are important as the monitoring tools for an organization.
- learned why logs and there understanding is important in the InfoSec industry.
- learned about SIEM tools such as Splunk , Google chronicle and how they are important as the monitoring tools for an organization.
- learned about playbooks and their importance as a guide during a security incident, which guides how to respond to an incident and post incident activities.

Key Learning: in order to keep up the business availability an organization should imply the frameworks as the baseline
# Course 3:

**Module 1: Network architecture**

learning the basic architecture of networks. learned about how physical network devices like workstations, servers, routers, and switches connect to each other to create a network. learned about cloud networks and how cloud computing has grown in recent years.

Learned about the components of Cloud service providers:

SaaS: software as service, where we can use software without hosting it.

Paas: Platform as a service, where developers can use services to design and develop custom applications for their organization.

Iaas: Infrastructure as a service, where virtual components of a system like containers , virtual pcs can be host. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. 

Learned about the basic structure of a Data Packet, which includes data header: The sender’s IP address, the destination's MAC address, and the protocol to use, body and the footer which contains a string of data indicating that the data transmission is complete.

 learned about the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model and its detailed structure and layers. TCP/IP consists of four layers : Network layer, Internet, Transport layer and Application Layer.

Learned about difference between TCP and UDP, how TCP is an essential and reliable way of communication as it forms connection before transmitting packets unlike the UDP.

Learned about the OSI model , whose seven layers help the connection between two devices and the transmission of packets. learned how each model is necessary in order to achieve safe connection and data sharing. 

**Module 2: Network operations**

**Module 3: Secure against network intrusions**

**Module 4: Security hardening**

# Google-Cybersecurity-

This Repository describes about the journey of getting the google cybersecurity professional certificate.

This course contains 8 different courses which combinely makes the certificate.

# First Course :
Foundations of Cybersecurity
 This was the begining where almost the overview of every course was given. Learned about the SIEM Tools, Frameworks , Some popular attacks like the LoveLetter, which shaped the infosec community, NIST frameworks, CIA triad, and other base info sec knowledge.

 # Second Course : 
 Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks
 This course dive deep into Frameworks like NIST and controls , CIA triad, OWASP principles etc.
 
 In first two modules some key learnings were:
- How frameworks helps in lowering the risk in crucial time
- learned how framework provides guidance to act and investigate the issue and prevent the further damage,recover data loss or any harm during the breach or other compromised times.
- CISSP's eight principles which are followed by organisations in order to comply security of domains.
- identify, protect using tools, policies and procedures, detect using improvised techniques, respond using security processes, recover the system.
- Learned about the security audits how these audits helps organizations in keeping up there business needs and goals.
- Performed a security audit for a fictional company Botium Toys, learned about how to review security scope and goals, reviewed and finalize the availability and usage of important security compliances.
- learned why logs and there understanding is important in the InfoSec industry.
- learned about SIEM tools such as Splunk , Google chronicle and how they are important as the monitoring tools for an organization.
- learned why logs and there understanding is important in the InfoSec industry.
- learned about SIEM tools such as Splunk , Google chronicle and how they are important as the monitoring tools for an organization.
- learned about playbooks and their importance as a guide during a security incident, which guides how to respond to an incident and post incident activities.

Key Learning: in order to keep up the business availability an organization should imply the frameworks as the baseline
# Course 3:

**Module 1: Network architecture**

- learning the basic architecture of networks. learned about how physical network devices like workstations, servers, routers, and switches connect to each other to create a network. learned about cloud networks and how cloud computing has grown in recent years.

- Learned about the components of Cloud service providers:

SaaS: software as service, where we can use software without hosting it.

Paas: Platform as a service, where developers can use services to design and develop custom applications for their organization.

Iaas: Infrastructure as a service, where virtual components of a system like containers , virtual pcs can be host. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. 

- Learned about the basic structure of a Data Packet, which includes data header: The sender’s IP address, the destination's MAC address, and the protocol to use, body and the footer which contains a string of data indicating that the data transmission is complete.

 - learned about the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) model and its detailed structure and layers. TCP/IP consists of four layers : Network layer, Internet, Transport layer and Application Layer.

- Learned about difference between TCP and UDP, how TCP is an essential and reliable way of communication as it forms connection before transmitting packets unlike the UDP.

- Learned about the OSI model , whose seven layers help the connection between two devices and the transmission of packets. learned how each model is necessary in order to achieve safe connection and data sharing. 

**Module 2: Network operations**
- learned about network protocols like tcp, icmp, smtp, sftp, https, udp, dns, snmp and how they organize communication over a network.
- learned about different wireless protocols such as wep, wpa, wpa2, wpa3
- learned about firewalls and proxy servers.
- Learned how firewalls can be configured as hardware, software and cloud based which uses FaaS in order to get protection for the organization’s network .
- Learned how stateless and statefull firewalls are differ from each other.
- Learned about the vpns and security zones., learned about the uncontrolled zone, the controlled zone, the demilitarized zone, and the restricted zone.
- learned about network segmentation, a security technique that divides networks into sections. A private network can be segmented to protect portions of the network from the internet, which is an unsecured global network.

**Module 3: Secure against network intrusions**
- learned how packet sniffing and IP spoofing are used in network attacks. Because these attacks intercept data packets as they travel across the network, they are called interception attacks.
- learned about how to read and understand log files of popular packet sniffing tools like tcpdump and wireshark.
- learned about how dos attack works and how as a security analyst we can resume and prevent the services after an attack occurred.

**Module 4: Security hardening**

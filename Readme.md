In this activity, we used Chronicle to investigate a suspicious domain used in a phishing email. Using Chronicle's domain search, we were able to:

- Access threat intelligence reports on the domain
    
- Identify the assets that accessed the domain
    
- Evaluate the HTTP events associated with the domain
    
- Identify which assets submitted login information to the domain
    
- Identify additional domains

After investigation, we determined that the suspicious domain has been involved in phishing campaigns. We also determined that multiple assets might have been impacted by the phishing campaign as logs showed that login information was submitted to the suspicious domain via POST requests. Finally, we identified two additional domains related to the suspicious domain by examining the resolved IP address.
**Tools** Used : **Suricata**, **Splunk** and **Google Chronicle**.
